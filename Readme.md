Hey everyone , glad you came to have a look at my projects on github. I have been working with web development keenly and has been able to grasp some very keen concepts. This a website built entirely from scratch by me in my first year which kind of reflects my work, if not completely then just a glimpse of it. Feel free to go through the url in the description to visit my small lovely website. I am listing the key technologies used in the project:

 - Pug : Pug is a high performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for Node.js and browsers.
 - Less : Less (which stands for Leaner Style Sheets) is a backwards-compatible language extension for CSS.
 - Webpack : Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
 - NodeJs : Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
 
Hope you can aprreciate the work.
